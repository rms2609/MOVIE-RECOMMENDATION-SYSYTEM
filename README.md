A collaborative filtering algorithm usually works by searching a large group of people
and finding a smaller set with tastes similar to yours. It looks at other things they
like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions.
Based on the ratings given by various critics to different movies, points were plotted in 
euclidean plane and distance between them is used to find the relation between any two critics.
Based on Euclidean distance between any two points we can find how much similarity is there between any two given critic
and they relative to users interest we can suggest the critics which he is likely to like the most.
